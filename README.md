simple-animator-metronome
=========================

A simple, HTML based, animator metronome. A little tool I did as a iGoogle widget (now dead) but able to work as a standalone page.

It has:

* Common frames per second (fps) for film and video.
* Time to frames and frames to time calculator (based on the selected frame rate)
* Metronome, allowing to set you a pace in beats-per-minute, or every n-frames. You can also set a number of sub-beats, or tap a rythm and get the rate.
* Chronograph, to act out and get a time-sheet of your actions.
